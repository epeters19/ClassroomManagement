# Classroom Management and the Rescorla-Wagner model
using the Rescorla-Wagner model to illustrate functional behavior theory and classroom management 
# Classroom Management: Rescorla-Wagner Model Implementation

## Overview
This project applies the Rescorla-Wagner model to classroom management and functional behavioral intervention, providing a computational approach to understanding associative learning in disciplinary behaviors.

## Background
The Rescorla-Wagner model is a pioneering psychological theory that explains how associations are learned and modified through interactions. In this project, we adapt the model to classroom behavioral dynamics.

## Features
- Computational modeling of classroom behavioral interventions
- Implementation of the Rescorla-Wagner learning algorithm
- Visualization of associative strength in learning disciplinary behaviors

## Prerequisites
- R Programming Language
- Basic understanding of statistical modeling
- Familiarity with behavioral learning theories (recommended)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[epeters19]/classroom-management
```
2. Ensure R is installed on your system
3. Open the R script in your preferred R environment

## Usage
Run the R script to:
- Simulate classroom behavioral scenarios
- Analyze associative learning patterns
- Explore intervention effectiveness

## Example
```r
# Sample code snippet demonstrating model usage
classroom_model <- rescorla_wagner_model(initial_conditions)
results <- analyze_behavioral_intervention(classroom_model)
```

## Research Implications
This model can help educators:
- Understand learning mechanisms in behavioral interventions
- Develop more effective classroom management strategies
- Quantify the impact of different behavioral approaches
